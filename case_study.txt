Three Suggestions for Improvement

1. Make CTA's at bottom of B2C blog articles seem less like banner ads, and thus, more inviting to interact within
2. Content-wise in B2C, the blog categories are too general for the average reader, so that it would be hard to find relevant content. Additionally, the articles' audiences range from recent graduates to experience professionals.
3. The differentiation between the blog 'logo' and the kununu logo is not clear, which might frustrate readers.
4. I don't think the B2B website is a blog, as new material is not added regularly
